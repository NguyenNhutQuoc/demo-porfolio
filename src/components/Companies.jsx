                  During my internship at Biz4 Group, I gained valuable
                  experience in web programming, specifically focusing on the
                  back-end and data aspects. For back-end development, I used
                  .NET Core, and for data management, I worked with Microsoft
                  SQL Server. Additionally, I had the opportunity to learn about
                  teamwork, effective work practices, and problem-solving
                  skills.

                  When I took on both positions officially, I had the
                  opportunity to take on a lot of responsibilities, which
                  naturally came with increased pressure. However, I was able to
                  handle all of those pressures. During my time in these two
                  roles, I learned a great deal about back-end and data
                  development. Specifically, I gained knowledge on organizing
                  data, writing efficient and maintainable C# code, and
                  optimizing stored procedures for maximum effectiveness. I
                  continued to learn and expand my skills in various other areas
                  as well.
